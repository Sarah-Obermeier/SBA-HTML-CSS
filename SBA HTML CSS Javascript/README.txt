This website is a partial remake of my old kana quiz android app. Includes a landing page with top links to a login page as well as a couple links to starting a quiz and loging in. 

The login page includes an email with regex verification and password entry. The login button does not work.

Quiz page shows the kana to be translated and a dropdown for type of kana. Website currently uses a blank image. Selecting Hiragana or Katakana from the dropdown and clicking the Start button will change the blank image to the prospective character 'a'. Selecting "both" will show the hiragana character 'a'. Finish button currently does nothing.

Operated using Opera GX. Trying to use chrome did not show the background image on my pc however. Everything else should work properly
